-Outline of the game
The player controls a character on the right hand side of the screen. It can move in all directions but limited to the right half of the screen. It shoots and the shots always go left. The player starts off with int lives; int hitPoints. On the higher levels there will be an increase in lives/hitPoints.
On the left side of the screen we have a castle. It shoots cannon balls at the player that the player has to avoid. The castle has int hitPoints; int resistance. When int resistence drops to 0 after being hit enough times by the player, a wizard/Nakov/ninja emerges from its walls and asks the player a question (on javascript). If the player answers correctly, they move on to the next level. If not- the wizard hits him with a lightning bolt and its game over.

*Once we finish with these basics we can add more items and so on. New ideas are welcome.*

* Information about js libraries we have discussed

ALL js frameworks have been added to the .gitignore.
To install and keep up to date with them follow these instructions:

1. Install node.js with npm (npm is a package manager. It usually downloads automatically with node.js. To check if you already have them installed or see the version you are using open cmd and run node -v (this will show the version installed) and npm list -g (this will list all globally installed packages) )
2. Install bower http://bower.io/#install-bower  *run commands from git shell 
3. Go to the js directory in the repository (in the git shell again) and run bower install - this will install all the libraries you'll need and if any others are added you can use the same command to keep everything up to date
